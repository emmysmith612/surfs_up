## Overview of Project


For this activity we utilized Pandas and SQL Alchemy to extract data from Hawaii.sqlite, in order to
compare temperatures for the months of June and December. After the temperatures were extracted
the values were converted into two separate displays to identify temperature changes for each month. 


## Results

•	One important thing to note is the minimum temperature for each month had a difference of about 8 degrees.  June had a minimum of 64, while December had a minimum of 56. 


•	Another thing to point out is June seemed to have more consistency when it came to temperature. June tended to stay in the 70s, while December bounced back and forth between the 50s to 70s range.  


•	 Lastly June seemed to receive a higher temperature count then December making more data available.


## Summary

In conclusion there is not a huge difference in temperature overall for each month, just a slight difference in the consistency of the temps. From this information it is safe to say there is a good chance opening a business year-round would be sustainable. Although December did reach a minimum of 56, the mean for December was 71 degrees which is only 4 degrees less than the mean temp for June.
